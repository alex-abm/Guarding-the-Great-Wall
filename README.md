# Guarding-the-Great-Wall

The Great Wall of China has multiple guarding posts, but not all have guards stationed. A wall section is considered guarded if at least one of its endpoints has a guard. Given the total number of posts and the indices of currently guarded posts, our task is to determine the minimum number of additional guards required to ensure full coverage of the wall.

The program will take the number of posts and currently guarded posts as input, process the unguarded sections, and compute the optimal number of additional guards needed. The goal is to efficiently allocate guards to ensure complete protection of the wall.
